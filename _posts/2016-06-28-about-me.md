# About me

I earned a Ph.D. in Classics from the University of Texas at Austin in 2013\. When I first encountered the writings of the Greeks and the Romans, I was drawn to their thoughts on the most important things in life. How do we live the best life possible? How do grow? What goes wrong and how do we fix it? My research focuses on the intersection between philosophy and literature. Specifically, I work with Epicurean philosophy in the poetry of Horace.
